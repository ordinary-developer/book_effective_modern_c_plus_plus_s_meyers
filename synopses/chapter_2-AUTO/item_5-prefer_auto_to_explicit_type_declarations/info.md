prefer auto to explicit type declarations
=========================================


base
----

the advantages of auto:
- avoidance of uninitialized variables
- verbose variable declarations
- ability to directly hold closures

std::function object can refer to any callable object

the "std::function" approach is generally bigger and slower than
the "auto" approach
